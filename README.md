## Day 0: July 06, 2018

Work: Optimising power consumption of home appliances, study on Regularisation and Feature engineering

Thoughts: It was to fun to start off 100DaysOfMLCode. It was difficult to manipulate pandas using custom functions

## Day 1: July 07, 2018

Work: 
1. Optimising power consumption of home appliances, applied regression and plotted graphs of power consumption
2. Created new dataset for power consumption by date, time, month 
3. Devices columns are added and new priority database of devices and weather is created 

Thoughts: Because the data in randomly generated, the graphs look similar and symmetric in nature. Will change as real dataset is provided.
