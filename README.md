# #100DaysOfMLCode

# Overview

This is a progress report of my pledge to [Siraj Raval's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo) #100DaysofMLCode challenge. I will be updating here to links, activities of my work involving Machine Learning. Let's roll!

## Day 0: July 06, 2018

Work: Optimising power consumption of home appliances, study on Regularisation and Feature engineering

Thoughts: It was to fun to start off 100DaysOfMLCode. It was difficult to manipulate pandas using custom functions

## Day 1: July 07, 2018

Work: 
1. Optimising power consumption of home appliances, applied regression and plotted graphs of power consumption
2. Created new dataset for power consumption by date, time, month 
3. Devices columns are added and new priority database of devices and weather is created 

Thoughts: Because the data in randomly generated, the graphs look similar and symmetric in nature. Will change as real dataset is provided.

## Day 2: July 08, 2018

Work: 
1. Study on GridSearch CV
2. Started the book Hands on Machine Learning with Tensorflow and Scikit

Thoughts: Machine Learning is more complicated than expected. The book that I am reading is pretty awesome!

## Day 3: July 09, 2018

Work: 
1. Coded custom algorithm to optimise power consumption of home appliances
2. Plotted power consumption rates and minimised power consumption based on priority

Thoughts: Data generated is run across different trails and multiple regression algorithms are applied
