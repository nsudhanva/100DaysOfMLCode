# #100DaysOfMLCode

# Overview

This is a progress report of my pledge to [Siraj Raval's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo) #100DaysofMLCode challenge. I will be updating here to links, activities of my work involving Machine Learning. Let's roll!

## Day 0: July 06, 2018

Work: Optimising power consumption of home appliances, study on Regularisation and Feature engineering

Thoughts: It was to fun to start off 100DaysOfMLCode. It was difficult to manipulate pandas using custom functions

## Day 1: July 07, 2018

Work: 
1. Optimising power consumption of home appliances, applied regression and plotted graphs of power consumption
2. Created new dataset for power consumption by date, time, month 
3. Devices columns are added and new priority database of devices and weather is created 

Thoughts: Because the data in randomly generated, the graphs look similar and symmetric in nature. Will change as real dataset is provided.

## Day 2: July 08, 2018

Work: 
1. Study on GridSearch CV
2. Started the book Hands on Machine Learning with Tensorflow and Scikit

Thoughts: Machine Learning is more complicated than expected. The book that I am reading is pretty awesome!

## Day 3: July 09, 2018

Work: 
1. Coded custom algorithm to optimise power consumption of home appliances
2. Plotted power consumption rates and minimised power consumption based on priority

Thoughts: Data generated is run across different trails and multiple regression algorithms are applied

## Day 4: July 10, 2018

Work: 
1. Generated new datasets and applied machine learning algorithms on the previous project
2. Results are calculated and power consumption is compared
3. Started the course, Tensorflow for Beginners

Thoughts: Tensorflow provides low level APIs and is much more complicated than expected. It also helps in creating custom machine learning models and algorithms

## Day 5: July 11, 2018

Work: 
1. Measured real data of Electrical Impedance Tomography
2. New dataset is created for both male and female candidates
3. Understood a couple of TensorFlow tutorials

Thoughts: EIT has high potential and can be used to classify affected human areas

Link to work: [Github](www.github.com/nsudhanva/home)

## Day 6: July 12, 2018

Work: 
1. Measured impedance of people and logged real data 
2. Dataset is created and is pre-processed

Thoughts: As the real data is small and has high distribution, further investigation and hypothesis has to be made

Link to work: [Github](www.github.com/nsudhanva/home)

## Day 7: July 13, 2018

Work: 
1. Analysed parameters for dataset
2. Read through multiple research papers for measuring impedance from people
3. Study on reccurent neural networks and convolutional neural networks

Thoughts: As the real data is small and has high distribution, further investigation and hypothesis has to be made

## Day 8: July 14, 2018

Work: 
1. Participated in Target-HR Hackathon 12 hr hackathon
2. Had to analyse and interpret results for a book dataset 
3. Completed the task given in time

Thoughts: One of the best hackathon I have ever been to. Kudos to Target HR for the great hackathon!

## Day 9: July 15, 2018

Work: 
1. Studied basics of Recurrent neural networks
2. Trained a model on Convolutional Neural networks 

Thoughts: Tensorflow GPU is much much faster than Tensorflow CPU

## Day 10: July 16, 2018

Work: 
1. Wrote documnetation for my project at work
2. Prepared a presentation for the same 
3. Tested out some code to understand a couple of custom functions

Thoughts: Documentation is boring but important!

## Day 11: July 17, 2018

Work: 
1. Wrote report for the Home automation project
2. Learnt about stock trading using Machine Learning 
3. Completed presentation given previously

Thoughts: Stock trading using Machine Learning has huge potential and opened my mind

## Day 12: July 18, 2018

Work: 
1. Prepared presentation for the Electrical Impedance Tomography Project
2. Read about feature selection and feature engineering
3. Started writing research paper on home automation devices

Thoughts: Writing research paper by using MS Word is a difficult skill!

Link to work: [Github](www.github.com/nsudhanva/eit/docs)

## Day 13: July 19, 2018

Work: 
1. Completed two courses on datacamp
2. Network analysis using NetworkX API 
3. Research paper on home automation devices

Thoughts: Network analysis is awesome!!

## Day 15: July 21, 2018

Work: 
1. Completed Research Paper
2. Study on Regression evalution metrics
3. Applied Regression evalution metrics to home database

Thoughts: Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, RMSE are intersting metrics
